Welcome to my personal page.

I am an Aeronautical Engineer with a growing interest in data, technology, and software development. My background in engineering has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and structured approaches to complex challenges.

Currently, I’m exploring the world of data science and programming, developing skills in tools such as Python, SQL, and data visualization libraries.

This site is a personal space where I share what I’m learning, my side projects, and experiments in technology and data.
